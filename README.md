# üêô GitHub Follower Check Application

This application helps you efficiently manage your GitHub following list. It identifies users who are **not following you back**, including those who may have unfollowed you. This streamlines the process, eliminating the need for tedious manual navigation on GitHub.

## üåê Live Demo

**[View Live Application](https://github-follower-check.netlify.app/)**

## ‚ú® Features

- **Identifies Non-Followers:** Quickly scans your following list and compares it against your follower list to pinpoint users not following you back.
- **Detects Unfollowers:** Helps you find users who previously followed you but have since unfollowed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive web interface built using **React** with pure CSS.
- **Clear Output Log:** Provides real-time updates and lists identified usernames within the application.
- **Manual Unfollow Facilitation:** Generates a list of usernames, allowing you to manually unfollow them on GitHub at your convenience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Warning

**Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is a highly sensitive credential.**

- **NEVER SHARE YOUR PAT:** Treat your PAT like a password. Do not share it or embed it in public-facing client-side code for sensitive operations.
- **CLIENT-SIDE LIMITATION:** This application is a **client-side demonstration** designed **for identification only**. It **DOES NOT** perform any unfollowing actions directly on GitHub to protect your PAT. Running write operations (like unfollowing) from client-side code where the PAT is directly visible is a significant security risk.
- **SECURE UNFOLLOWING:** For any automated or direct unfollowing actions, it is **highly recommended** to build a **SERVER-SIDE APPLICATION** (a proxy). This server would securely store your PAT and handle all interactions with the GitHub API.

## üöÄ How to Use the Application

1. **Access the Application:** Run the React development server locally or deploy the compiled application.
2. **Enter Your GitHub Username:** Type your exact GitHub username (e.g., `octocat`).
3. **Enter Your Personal Access Token (PAT):** Paste your PAT into the designated field. (See "How to Get Your Personal Access Token" below for instructions).
4. **Click 'Identify Non-Followers':** Start the scanning process.
5. **Review Output:** The "Bot Output" section will display the progress and a list of GitHub usernames that are not following you back.
6. **Manual Unfollow:** Use the provided list to manually navigate to those users' profiles on GitHub and unfollow them if desired.

## üîë How to Get Your Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. **Log in to GitHub:** Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and log into your account.
2. **Go to Settings:** Click your **profile picture** (top-right), then select **Settings**.
3. **Navigate to Developer Settings:** In the left sidebar, click **Developer settings**.
4. **Select Personal Access Tokens:** Under "Personal access tokens," click **Tokens (classic)**.
5. **Generate New Token:** Click the **Generate new token (classic)** button.
6. **Configure Token:**
   - **Note:** Give your token a clear name (e.g., "GitHubFollowerCheck").
   - **Expiration:** Set an expiration date (e.g., 7 or 30 days). **Avoid "No expiration"**.
   - **Select Scopes:** **Crucially**, select at least the `user:follow` scope under the "user" section. Only grant necessary permissions.
7. **Generate Token:** Click the **Generate token** button.
8. **COPY IMMEDIATELY:** GitHub displays the token **only once**. Copy it and save it securely.
